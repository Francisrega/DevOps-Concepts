Software Delivery Cycle:
    Software Delivery Cycle signifies the phases of software development. They are Analysis, Planning, Design, Development, Testing and Deployment. The first thing you do is to identify the problem, done in the analysis phase. Next comes planning, on how to solve the problem with the lowest risks. Following, once planning is over, you go to the design stage. In the design stage, it is important to have the stakeholders input when designing, because if costs overruns and they do not approve, the project can collapse. After the design is approved, the team developes the project. The team works together to follow blueprints and plans to accomplish the code. Once finalized, the code is tested to see how it works, what bugs it has and what's needed to make sure it checks off all initial requirements. Finally, the project is sent through deployment. Here, the shareholders can run the project through different testing environments, seeing if it's safe to realease into the market. Any errors or issues can be fixed before the project is realsed in to the market.

Test Driven Development:
    Test Driven Development refers to the approach where test cases are developed to check what the code of many features in the code of the software will do. Vari


Continuous Integration:
    Continuous Integration is the practice where developers integrate code in a shared repository, frequently and many times a day. Every integration can be verified by an automated build and automated tests. Errors are detected quickly and are located easier. Every change submitted is usually small, becuase of this if an error is found it can be addressed quickly.

Continuous Delivery:
    Continuous Delivery is where code changes are automatically prepared for a release to production. This lets developers automate testing beyond just unit tests so they can verify application updates across multiple dimensions before deploying to customers. It holds low risks releases, faster time to market, higher quality, lower costs, better products and happier teams. Because of the work is done in small batches, there is more interraction with customers, as the team receives feedback right away.

Configuration Management:
    The process for establishing and maintaining consistency of a products performance, functionality and physical attributes with the requirements, design and operational information throughtout it's life.
    It is widely used by military engineers to manage changes through the lifecycles in the systems, like their weapon systems. 

Containerization:
    Containerization is the encapsulation of software code and all it's dependencies, such as librarires, frameworks and configuration of files so it can run uniformly and consistently on any infrastructure. Because of Containerization, code only needs to be written once, and can be deployed anywhere. This uses fewer resources than virutal machines, proving to be more efficient.  

Cloud Scalability:
    Cloud Scalability is the ability to increase or decrease the size or power of an IT solution. Scalable cloud means that a company can add or remove storage size depending on their needs. By doing so, during periods of heavy traffic, they can increase their size to accomadte the surplus of traffic without issue. During slow periods, they can decrease their size. By doing so, a company can purchase exactly what is needed during the periods needed as they see fit.

Reliability:
    Reliability in software is the probability that software will work properly in a specific environment and for a given amount of time. The probability of failure is calculated by testing samples of all available inputs. Models are used to understand how and why software fails. Once identified, the issues are fixed to ensure that the software is going to work properly, without issues.
